    <abstract>
      <t> The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security 
        services.  The Internet Key Exchange protocol provides a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms should be used 
        in any given Security Association. To ensure interoperability between different implementations, it is
        necessary to specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and Usage guidance to ensure that 
        there is at least one algorithm 
        that all implementations will have available.  This document defines the current algorithm implementation
        requirements and usage guidance of IKEv2. This document does not update the algorithms used for packet
        encryption using IPsec Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP)</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
    
     
      <t> The Internet Key Exchange protocol <xref target="RFC7296" /> is used to negotiate the IPsec parameters,
        such as encryption algorithms and keys, for protected communications between two endpoints. The IKEv2 protocol
        itself is also protected by encryption, which is also negotiated between the two endpoints. Negotiation 
        is performed by IKEv2 itself. This document describes the encryption parameters of the IKE protocol,
        not the encryption parameters of the ESP (IPsec) protocol. Different implementations of IKEv2 
        may negotiate different encryption algorithms based on their individual local policy. To ensure interoperability,
        a set of "mandatory-to-implement" IKEv2 encryption algorithms is defined. </t>
        
     <section title="Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance">   
      <t> The field of cryptography evolves continiously. New stronger algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found
        to be less secure then originally thought. Therefore, algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance need
        to be updated from time to time to reflect the new reality. The choices for algorithms must be conservative
        to minimize the risk of algorithm compromised. Algorithms need to be suitable for a wide variety of CPU architectures
        and device deployments ranging from high end bulk encryption devices to small low-power IoT devices.</t>

      <t> The algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance may need to change over time to adapt 
      to the changing world. For this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement algorithms was removed
      from the main IKEv2 specification and placed in this document. </t>
     </section>
     
     <section title="Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels">
      <t> Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should already be available in most implementations 
        of IKE by the time it is made mandatory.  To facilitate this, this document attempts to identify those algorithms 
        for future mandatory-to-implement. There is no guarantee that the algorithms in use today may become mandatory
        in the future. Published algorithms are continiously subjected to cryptographic attack and may become too weak or
        could become completely broken before this document is updated.</t>

      <t> This document only provides recommendations for the mandatory-to-implement algorithms or algorithms
        too weak that are recommended not to be implemented. As a result, any algorithm not mentioned in this document
        MAY be implemented. For clarification and consistency with <xref target="RFC4307"/> an algorithm will be set to
        MAY only when it has been downgraded.</t>

      <t> Although this document updates the algorithms in order to keep the IKEv2 communication secure over time,
        it also aims at providing recommendations so that IKEv2 implementations remain interoperable. IKEv2 interoperability
        is addressed by an incremental introduction or deprecation of algorithms. In addition, this document also considers
        the new use cases for IKEv2 deployment, such as Internet of Things (IoT).</t>
      
      <t> It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm is performed gradually. This provides time for various
        implementations to update their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable. Unless there are strong
        security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be downgraded from MUST to MUST- or SHOULD, instead of MUST NOT.
        Similarly, an algorithm that has not been mentioned as mandatory-to-implement is expected to be introduced with a
        SHOULD instead of a MUST.</t>
      
      <t>The current trend toward Internet of Things and its adoption of IKEv2 requires this specific use case to be taken
       into account as well. IoT devices are resource constrainted devices and their choice of algorithms are motivated by
       minimizing the fooprint of the code, the computation effort and the size of the messages to send. This document
       indicates IoT when a specified algorithm is specifically listed for IoT devices.</t>  
     </section>

     <section title="Document Audience">
      <t>The recommendations of this document mostly target IKEv2 implementers as implementations needs to meet 
      both high security expectations as well as high interoperability between various vendors and with 
      different updates. Interoperability requires a smooth move to more secure cipher suites. This may 
      differ from a user point of view that may deploy and configure IKEv2 with only the safest cipher 
      suites. On the other hand, comments and recommendations are also expected to be useful for such users.</t>

      <t>IKEv1 is out of scope of this document. IKEv1 is deprecated and the recommendations of this document 
      must not be considered for IKEv1.</t>

          [1] - This requirement level is for 128-bit keys. 256-bit keys are at MAY. 192-bit keys can 
            safely be ignored.
          [IoT] - This requirement is for interoperability with IoT.           
            </postamble>
        </texttable>
        <t> ENCR_AES_CBC is raised from SHOULD+ in RFC4307. It is the only shared mandatory-to-implement algorithm 
        with RFC4307 and as a result is necessary for interoperability with IKEv2 implementation compatible with
        RFC4307.</t>
        <t> ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 was not ready to be considered at the time of RFC4307.
         It has been recommended by the CRFG and others as an alternative to AES and AES-GCM. It is also being
         standarized for IPsec for the same reasons. At the time of writing, there were not enough IKEv2 implementations
         of ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 to be able to introduce it at the SHOULD+ level.</t>
        <t> AES-GCM with a 16 octet ICV was not considered as in RFC4307. At the time RFC4307
        was written, AES-GCM was not defined in an IETF document. AES-GCM was defined for ESP in 
        <xref target="RFC4106"/> and later for IKEv2 in <xref target="RFC5282"/>. The main motivation for adopting
        AES-GCM for ESP is encryption performance as well as key longevity - compared to AES-CBC for example. 
        This resulted in AES-GCM widely implemented for ESP. As the load of IKEv2 is expected to remain 
        relatively small, many IKEv2 implementations do not include AES-GCM. In addition to its former MAY, this document
        does not promote AES-GCM to a greater status than SHOULD so to preserve interoperability between IKEv2
        implementations. [PAUL: I dont follow the reasoning, as we could have AES and AES-GCM at MUST level]
        This document considers AES-GCM as mandatory to implement to promote the slightly more secure AEAD method
        over the traditional encrypt+auth method. Its status is expected to be raised once widely deployed.</t>
        <t> ENCR_AES_CCM_8 was not considered in RFC4307. This document considers it 
        SHOULD be implemented in order to be able to interact with Internet of Things devices. As this case is 
        not a general use case for VPNs, its status is expected to remain to SHOULD. The size of the ICV is 
        expected to be sufficient for most use cases of IKEv2, as far less packets are exchanged on the IKE_SA
        compared to the IPsec SA. When implemented, ENCR_AES_CCM_8 MUST be implemented for key length 128 and 
        MAY be implemented for key length 256.</t>
        <t> ENCR_3DES has been downgraded from RFC4307 MUST-. All IKEv2 implementation already implement
        ENCR_AES_CBC, so there is no need to keep ENCR_3DES. In addition, ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 provides a more 
        modern alternative to AES. [PAUL: removed 'efficient' as we said above encryption efficiency at the IKE
        level hardly matters]</t>
        <t> ENCR_DES can be brute-forced using of-the-shelves hardware. It provides no meaningful security
          whatsoever and therefor MUST NOT be implemented.</t>

        <t>RSA Digital Signature is mostly kept for interoperability. It is expected to be downgraded 
        in the future as signatures are based on RSASSA-PKCS1-v1.5, not any more recommemded. 
        Instead, more robust use of RSA is expected to be performed via the Digital Signature method.</t>
        <t>ECDSA family are also expected to be downgraded as it does not provide hash function agility.
        Instead ECDSA is expected to be performed using the generic Digital Signature method.</t>
        <t>DSS Digital Signature is bound to SHA-1 and thus is expected to be downgraded to MUST NOT in the future.</t> 
        <t>Digital Signature is expected to be promoted as it provides hash function, signature format and algorithm agility.</t>

      <t>With the use of Digital Signature, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1.5 MAY be implemented, and RSASSA-PSS MUST be implemented.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> The security of cryptographic-based systems depends on both the strength of the cryptographic algorithms 
        chosen and the strength of the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering 
        of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security 
        of the overall system.</t>
      <t> The Diffie-Hellman Groups parameter is the most important one to choose conservatively. Any party capturing
          all traffic that can break the selected DH group can retroactively gain access to the symmetric keys used
          to encrypt all the IPsec data. However, specifying extremely large DH group also puts a considerable load
          on the device, especially when this is a large VPN gateway or an IoT constrained device.</t>
      <t> This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic algorithms for the use of IKEv2, 
        specifically with the selection of "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified in this 
        document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known to be broken at the current time, and 
        cryptographic research so far leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the foreseeable 
        future.  However, this isn't necessarily forever  and it is expected that new revisions of this 
        document will be issued from time to time to reflect the current best practice in this area.</t>
