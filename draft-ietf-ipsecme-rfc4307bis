    <abstract>
      <t> The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security 
        services.  The Internet Key Exchange protocol provides a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms should be used 
        in any given association.  However, to ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is 
        necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one algorithm 
        that all implementations will have available.  This document defines the current set of algorithms that are 
        mandatory to implement as part of IKEv2, as well as algorithms that should be implemented because they may be 
        promoted to mandatory at some future time.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t> The Internet Key Exchange protocol <xref target="RFC7296" /> provides for the negotiation of cryptographic 
        algorithms between both endpoints of a cryptographic association.  Different implementations of IPsec and IKE 
        may provide different algorithms.  However, the IETF desires that all implementations should have some way to 
        interoperate.  In particular, this requires that IKE define a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms because 
        IKE itself uses such algorithms as part of its own negotiations.  This requires that some set of algorithms be 
        specified as "mandatory-to-implement" for IKE.</t>
      <t> The nature of cryptography is that new algorithms surface continuously and existing algorithms are 
        continuously attacked.  An algorithm believed to be strong today may be demonstrated to be weak tomorrow.  
        Given this, the choice of mandatory-to-implement algorithm should be conservative so as to minimize the 
        likelihood of it being compromised quickly.  Thought should also be given to performance considerations as 
        many uses of IPsec will be in environments where performance is a concern.</t>
      <t> Finally, we need to recognize that the mandatory-to-implement algorithm(s) may need to change over time to 
        adapt to the changing world.  For this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement algorithms was removed 
        from the main IKEv2 specification and placed in this document.  As the choice of algorithm changes, only this 
        document should need to be updated.</t>
      <t> Ideally, the mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should already be available in most implementations 
        of IPsec by the time it is made mandatory.  To facilitate this, we will attempt to identify those algorithms 
        (that are known today) in this document.  There is no guarantee that the algorithms we believe today may be 
        mandatory in the future will in fact become so.  All algorithms known today are subject to cryptographic attack 
        and may be broken in the future.</t>

        <c>MUST-</c><c>This term means the same as MUST.  However, we expect at some point that this algorithm will no 
          longer be a MUST in a future document.  Although its status will be determined at a later time, it is 
          reasonable to expect that if a future revision of a document alters the status of a MUST- algorithm, it will 
          remain at least a SHOULD or a SHOULD-.</c>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> The security of cryptographic-based systems depends on both the strength of the cryptographic algorithms 
        chosen and the strength of the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering 
        of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security 
        of the overall system.</t>
      <t> This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic algorithms for the use of IKEv2, 
        specifically with the selection of "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified in this 
        document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known to be broken at the current time, and 
        cryptographic research so far leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the foreseeable 
        future.  However, this isn't necessarily forever.  We would therefore expect that new revisions of this 
        document will be issued from time to time that reflect the current best practice in this area.</t>
