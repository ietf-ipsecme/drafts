    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t> The Internet Key Exchange protocol <xref target="RFC7296" /> can use 
        arbitrary signature algorithms as described in 
        <xref target="RFC7427" />.  The latter RFC defines the 
        SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification where each side of the IKE 
        negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms. This assumes that all 
        signature schemes involve a hashing phase followed by a signature 
        phase. This made sense because most signature algorithms either cannot 
        sign messages bigger than their key or truncate messages bigger than 
        their key.</t>
      <t> EdDSA (<xref target="I.D-eddsa" />) defines signature methods that do 
        not require pre-hashing of the message. Unlike other methods, these 
        accept arbitrary-sized messages, so no pre-hashing is required. These 
        methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448, which respectively use the 
        Edwards 25519 and the Edwards 448 ("Goldilocks") curves. Although that 
        document also defines pre-hashed versions of these algorithm, those 
        versions are not recommended for protocols where the entire 
        to-be-signed message is available at once.</t>
      <t> EdDSA defines the binary format of the signatures that should be used 
        in the "Signature Value" field of the Authentication Data Format in 
        section 3. The CURDLE PKIX document (<xref target="I.D-curdle-pkix"/>) 
        defines the object identifiers (OIDs) for these signature methods. For 
        convenience, these OIDs are repeated in <xref target="the_oids"/>.</t>
      <t> In order to signal within IKE that no hashing needs to be done, we 
        define a new value has in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification, 
        one that indicates that no hashing is performed.</t> 
      <section anchor="mustshouldmay" title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
          document are to be interpreted as described in 
          <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="identity" title='The "Identity" Hash Identifier'>
      <t> This document defines a new value called "Identity" (value TBA by 
        IANA) in the hash algorithm registry for use in the 
        SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification. Inserting this new value into 
        the notification indicates that the receiver supports at least one 
        signature algorithm that accepts arbitrary-sized messages such as 
        Ed25519 and Ed448.</t>
      <t> Ed25519 and Ed448 are only defined with the Identity hash, and MUST 
        NOT be sent to a receiver that has not indicated support for the 
        "Identity" hash.</t> 
      <t> The pre-hashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph 
        respectively) SHOULD NOT be used in IKE.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> The new "Identity" value is needed only for signature algorithms that 
        accept an arbitrary-sized input. It MUST NOT be used if none of the 
        supported algorithms has this property. On the other hand there is no 
        good reason to pre-hash the inputs where the signature algorithm either 
        does not require it or performs a hash internally. For this reason 
        implementations SHOULD have the "Identity" value in the 
        SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification when they support EdDSA. 
        Implementations SHOULD NOT have other hash algorithms in the 
        notification if all signature algorithms have this property.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">  
      <t>IANA is requested to assign a new value from the "IKEv2 Hash 
        Algorithms" registry with name "Identity" and this document as 
        reference. Since the value zero was reserved by RFC 7427 and this 
        "Identity" hash is no hash at all, assigning the value zero to Identity 
        seems appropriate.</t>
